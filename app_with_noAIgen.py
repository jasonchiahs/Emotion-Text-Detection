### How It Works
This application uses text emotion analysis to recommend songs that resonate with your current feelings. Simply type in an emotion, and we'll provide a selection of songs to match.

### Examples of Emotions:
- Happiness:    Spending time with you always makes me smile.
- Sadness:      I canâ€™t believe I lost my job.
- Love:         You are so romantic and make me feel so sweet
- Anger:        I hate my neighbours pets
- Fear:         I am having nightmares among everyday
- Surprise:     This is amazing! How did you do that!
### What to Expect:
After entering your emotion, you will see a list of songs that are curated based on your input.
Enjoy the music and let it uplift your spirits!
