# Emotion Recognition using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project uses logistic regression to classify and interpret the current emotions of users based on their input data. It provides an interactive user interface that displays the predicted emotion along with a corresponding message and image.

## Features
- Predicts user emotions: Sad, Happy, Love, Angry, Scared, Surprise
- Displays a message and an image representing the predicted emotion
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages:

# bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonchiahs/Emotion-Text-Detection.git
cd emotion-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements
Python 3.x
Streamlit
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
OpenAI
(Other dependencies as needed)

## Usage
Run the application:
terminal: streamlit run app.py
Follow the instructions on the web interface to input data and receive emotion predictions.

# Model Training
The logistic regression model was trained on Kaggle: Emotion dataset to predict emotions based on 'text' & 'label'.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss improvements.

# Room for improvement
There is still significant room for improvement in this project. The dataset used is not as clean as anticipated, which can impact the model's performance. This project serves as a showcase of my ability to implement NLP models using both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Moving forward, I aim to explore various models and leverage more powerful computational resources to enhance the performance of the system. My ultimate goal is to secure a position as a machine learning engineer in the near future.
